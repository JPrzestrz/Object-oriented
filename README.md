# Object-oriented
Repository for projects using object-oriented programming

In this repository I saved my project for Object-Oriented Programming classes on Gdanks University of Technology. Organisms game is a simple game in which you can move 
organism that I call Human and there are also different other organisms that are acting in some way that I programmed them for. At first we choose the size of the map 
and the percent of density of organisms spawned. Only Human can be moved by user and every other organisms works on it's own. There are several actions that can happen 
when collision occurs.
